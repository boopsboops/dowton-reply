\opening{Dear Prof.\ Anderson,} 

Re: revision of manuscript USYB-2014-135

%Please find attached a revised manuscript entitled ``Known knowns, known unknowns, unknown unknowns and unknown knowns in DNA barcoding: a comment on Dowton et al.'' by Rupert A.\ Collins and Robert H.\ Cruickshank for consideration as a point-of-view article in \emph{Systematic Biology}. 

In response to the comments from yourself and Academic Editor Tanja Stadler, we have carried out the following alterations to the manuscript: (i) minor points 1, 2 and 3 were changed as suggested; (ii) the paragraph regarding computation problems was extended (page 6, paragraph 1); and (iii) we added a sentence (page 6, paragraph 1 also) stating that exemplar datasets for benchmarking are required. We have also added a funding statement, as well as section headings to the manuscript, should these be needed.

We hope that these changes are satisfactory, and we are looking forward to seeing the article in print. 

\closing{Yours sincerely,\\
