Dear Prof. Anderson,

In response to the comments from yourself, Tanja Stadler, and the reviewers, we have carried out the following alterations to the manuscript: 

(1) Minor points 1, 2 and 3 were changed as suggested.

(2) The paragraph regarding computation problems was extended, and also now incorporates a statement about  the need for suitable benchmarking datasets (page 6, section entitled "Practical Issues").

(3) Minor modifications for clarity were carried out on the following sentences: 

	L115: added "S. australis KM673"
	L130-L134: sentence restructured
	L164: start of sentence changed
	L195: "hundreds of thousands" changed to "millions"
	L197: "Post-Sanger" changed to "Parallel"
	L216-L218:  sentence restructured

(4) Section headings added to manuscript.

(5) Funding statement and Supplementary Material sections added.


We hope that these changes are satisfactory, and we are looking forward to seeing the article in print.

Yours sincerely,

Rupert A. Collins & Robert H. Cruickshank
